# StarCraft2 Build Order Helper Script

StarCraft II - Build order and reminder Script Solely for Educational and Training purpose. Soucne reminder based on timings, issuing routine units (probes, army). 

It is hard to remember the main build order and be in timing at the same time during game, when a gamer has to focus on fights and planning and at the same time be synchronized with timing to issue units and army as soon as minerals and gas will be available.

For that purpose, we have created and tested a custom trainer and a reminder script running on AutoIt platform to get experienced and tailored with timing with predefined build script, which can be customized.

this one is just a early version, written and tailored for protos race only, but it already helped me to train my memory and timing during game play.

Hope if any one will find it Useful we will be able to upgrade the script to add other races and make it more customizable and stable :)

it is open for questions and teamwork.
