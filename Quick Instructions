To Start Script --> 
1. run it in background 
2. when game starts, u have to select and assign first "Nexus" as CTRL + 0 Group.
3. Script will be enabled and build order will be activated.
4. If you build another Nexus, u have to select and add them to 0 Group 
   by selecting 2nd nexus and pressing "shift" + "0"
5. Probes will be issued automatically as soon as first nexus will be added to group 0.
6. assign Gateway same way to group 9, that would activate issuing Army (zealot and stalkers)
7. to stop press CTRL + P, to delay by 5 seconds press "CTRL" + "-"
8. DO not assign group 5 to anything, it is reserved for script.
Have fun to adapt.
